# TCP_multichat_app

**TCP_multichat_app is a multi-user chat application developed in C++ using the Qt framework.**

**It was created as part of a university programming course to gain hands-on experience with socket programming, networking protocols, and client-server architecture. The application uses the TCP protocol to enable real-time communication between multiple clients through a central server.**

**This project helped solidify understanding of TCP/IP basics, asynchronous data handling, and event-driven communication in Qt, as well as concepts like connection management, message broadcasting, and network thread separation.**
